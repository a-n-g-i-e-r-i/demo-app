# You must create custom environment variables beginning with REACT_APP_.
# 
# Any other variables except NODE_ENV will be ignored to avoid accidentally 
# exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name.
# 
# Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development 
# server if it is running.
# 
# .env files should be checked into source control (with the exclusion of .env*.local).
